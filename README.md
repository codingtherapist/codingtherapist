## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 

  - A 5-minute stretch break web application for developers and computer users.   This site is being built with <b>HMTL, CSS, Javascript, Nodejs and MongoDB</b>. An API to retrieve yoga poses based on body parts from a mongodb database with photo hosting from Cloudinary will be added to optimize project.

  - A full-stack CRUD web application for uploading silent mental, emotional or physical health diagnoses and treatment tips anonymously. This site is being built using <b>HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB</b>.<br><br>

## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
* yoga tips and stretch breaks for developers
* web accessibility and assistive technology 
* ergonomics (standing desks and specialized keyboards/ mice have saved my life!)<br><br>


## âš¡ Fun fact:
One of the reasons I transitioned from the therapy field to technology is because I became more interested in problem-solving how to make the virtual therapy tools I was using better and more accessible (streamlining documentation tools, building therapeutic gaming rooms, etc).<br><br>
