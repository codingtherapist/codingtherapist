# Hi, I'm Africa! 
I am a web developer, asccessibility specialist and former occupational therapist.
## I enjoy:
* community building
* learning in public
* advocating for the well-being of developers
* problem-solving creative solutions for accessibility <br><br>

## How to reach me: 
* All of my social links in one place: [My personal site](https://africamincey.netlify.app/)<br><br>
* My technical writing, vlogs and projects: [My Blog Site](https:www.africakenyah.com)<br><br>

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning:
* how to build responsive full stack web applications using Javascript
* how to build RESTful API's using the MERN stack
* the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 - W3C<br><br>

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 

  - A 5-minute stretch break web application for developers and computer users.   This site is being built with <b>HMTL, CSS, and vanilla Javascript</b>. An API to retrieve yoga poses based on body parts will be added using nodejs, express, and mongoDB.
  - A full-stack CRUD web application for uploading silent mental, emotional or physical health diagnoses and treatment tips anonymously. This site is being built using <b>HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB</b>.<br><br>

## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
* yoga tips and stretch breaks for developers
* web accessibility and assistive technology 
* ergonomics (standing desks and specialized keyboards/ mice have saved my life!)<br><br>


## âš¡ Fun fact:
One of the reasons I transitioned from the therapy field to technology is because I became more interested in problem-solving how to make the virtual therapy tools I was using better and more accessible (streamlining documentation tools, building therapeutic gaming rooms, etc).<br><br>
