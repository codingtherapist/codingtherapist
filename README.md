## Hi, I'm Africa!
 ### I am a web developer, occupational therapist, and assistive technology specialist
I enjoy:
* community building
* learning in public
* advocating for the mental, emotional, and physical well-being of developers
* problem-solving creative solutions for accessibility <br><br>

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning:
* how to build responsive full stack web applications using Javascript
* how to build RESTful API's using the MERN stack
* the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 - W3C<br><br>

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 

  - A 5-minute stretch break web application for developers and computer users.   This site is being built with <b>HMTL, CSS, and vanilla Javascript</b>. An API to retrieve yoga poses based on body parts will be added using nodejs, express, and mongoDB.
  - A full-stack CRUD web application for uploading silent mental, emotional or physical health diagnoses and treatment tips anonymously. This site is being built using <b>HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, and hosted on Netlify</b>.<br><br>

ðŸ’¬ Ask me:
* for yoga tips for developers
* about my fascination with assistive technology 
* about my obsession with ergonomics (standing desks and specialized keyboards/ mice have saved my life!)<br><br>
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [On my personal site](https://africamincey.netlify.app/)<br><br>

âš¡ Fun fact: One of the reasons I transitioned from the therapy field to technology is because I became more interested in problem-solving how to make the virtual therapy tools I was using better and more accessible (streamlining documentation tools, building therapeutic gaming rooms, etc).<br><br>

<b>Bonus:</b> Interested in learning beginner-friendly stretches for developers who sit at a computer all day? Check out the first issue of the Biweekly Stretch of the Week Newsletter below and [Subscribe here for more](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/Africakenyah?via=twitter-profile)
