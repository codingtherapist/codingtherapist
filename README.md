## 🔭 I’m currently working on 

  - A 5-minute stretch break web application for developers and computer users.   This site is being built with <b>HMTL, CSS, and vanilla Javascript</b>. An API to retrieve yoga poses based on body parts will be added using nodejs, express, and mongoDB.
  - A full-stack CRUD web application for uploading silent mental, emotional or physical health diagnoses and treatment tips anonymously. This site is being built using <b>HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB</b>.<br><br>

## 💬 Ask me about:
* yoga tips and stretch breaks for developers
* web accessibility and assistive technology 
* ergonomics (standing desks and specialized keyboards/ mice have saved my life!)<br><br>


## ⚡ Fun fact:
One of the reasons I transitioned from the therapy field to technology is because I became more interested in problem-solving how to make the virtual therapy tools I was using better and more accessible (streamlining documentation tools, building therapeutic gaming rooms, etc).<br><br>
