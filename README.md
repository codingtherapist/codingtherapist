# Hi, I'm Africa! 
I am a web developer, yoga teacher and former occupational therapist.<br>

## I enjoy:
* community building
* learning and building in public
* advocating for the well-being of developers
* problem-solving creative solutions for accessibility
* creating beautiful websites and tinkering with code <br><br>

## ðŸŒ± My skills:
* Building responsive full stack web applications using Javascript, React, Nodejs, MongoDB
* Building RESTful API's using the MERN stack
* Technical copy writing and content creation
* Robust knowledge of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 - W3C<br><br>

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 

  - [A 5-minute stretch break web application for developers and computer users](www.yourstretchbreak.com).   This site is being built with <b>HMTL, CSS, Javascript, Nodejs and MongoDB</b>. An API to retrieve yoga poses based on body parts from a mongodb database with photo hosting from Cloudinary will be added to optimize project.
  - ![screenshot of my stretch break app](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96845068/193476091-a9e68a0f-52ae-42dd-a61c-8c35fb0be827.gif)

  - A full-stack CRUD web application for uploading silent mental, emotional or physical health diagnoses and treatment tips anonymously. This site is being built using <b>HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB</b>.<br><br>

## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
* yoga tips and stretch breaks for developers
* web accessibility and assistive technology 
* ergonomics (standing desks and specialized keyboards/ mice have saved my life!)<br><br>


## âš¡ Fun fact:
One of the reasons I transitioned from the therapy field to technology is because I became more interested in problem-solving how to make the virtual therapy tools I was using better and more accessible (streamlining documentation tools, building therapeutic gaming rooms and web pages, etc).<br><br>
